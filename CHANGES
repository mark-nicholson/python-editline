Version 1.1.1
-------------

Correcting behaviour on more bare-bones systems.

- Fixed bug where builtin-builds still expected system histedit.h
- Upgraded support in the configuration checker to look for 'ncursesw'
  subdir in the system paths to find the ncurses headers.
- Improved the configuration error reporting to make the display more
  evident of what needs to be done.  
- Did some validation of the completion support with UTF-8 attributes and
  dictionary keys
