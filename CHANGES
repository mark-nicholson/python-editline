Repairing some bugs which were relative corner cases

- Validated that the modules works in Python 3.7.6 (Linux)
- fixed: seg-fault where really big commands were used
- Increase the resilience of the completer against dict-ish objects
- Fixed issue where sets would improperly handle the "index" syntax
- Updated the test suite to fix all outstanding issue
- Added a new test to verify that "large" commands don't crash
- Update the documentation


Version 2.0.0
-------------

Major upgrade to implement bug fixes, documentation and testing on all platforms

- Updating all documentation to support the latest testing efforts
- Last verification, testing, regression and debug for this release
- Tweaking the pip installation instructions to match the command re-arrangement.
- Repairing buffer overrun bug.
- Removing legacy support implemented to handle rlcompleter.
- Adding pylint to the default venv build.
- Removing unused and unnecessary functionality.
- Refactoring internal code to make call_editline and readline() apis use common underlying functionality
- Refactoring i/o support
- Correcting scoping bug to fix access to global line-editor instance.
- Adding first cut at proper documentation
- Adding support for arbitrary "private commands"
- Testing infrastructure improvements
- Enhancing support to handle whitespace between [ and ' on dictionary completions
- Improved the checking of object types to be more careful about inspecting objects to see if they are dict, list, set, ...
- Adding support for whitespace at the end of a command and in between the [ and the value
- Added a test for instances which implement __getitem__ when tabbed after [
- Added testing for expr-eval where the expr has a function call
  * added basic/normal case where no completion should occur
  * second case enables the flag and sees the completion happen
- Reduced complexity to have only one comparison variable
- Resolved testing and completions symantics of set and frozenset
- Added delete_text routine to _editline to allow higher level code to rub-out characters if needed
- Separating 'sets' from 'lists' in completions as sets are not indexable
- Upgraded expty to use a timeout-exception properly
- Fixed: bug where hex(12<tab> would provide completions
- Enabling functionality to manage calls within the evaluated expression
- Adding a more formal infra for debugging.
- Adding files to enable or document additional test functionality needed.
- Fixed: tabbing on a dictionary object just after the [ would go into array mode
- Incorporating some targets to create a testbed sandbox and test-cmd.
- Adding regression exclusions to avoid clutter.
- Test support upgrade
- Refactoring testing to make building tests easier.
- Added test support for UTF-8 situations
- Upgraded parser passes all pre-existing test-cases.


Version 1.1.1
-------------

Correcting behaviour on more bare-bones systems.

- Fixed bug where builtin-builds still expected system histedit.h
- Upgraded support in the configuration checker to look for 'ncursesw'
  subdir in the system paths to find the ncurses headers.
- Improved the configuration error reporting to make the display more
  evident of what needs to be done.  
- Did some validation of the completion support with UTF-8 attributes and
  dictionary keys

Version 1.1.0
